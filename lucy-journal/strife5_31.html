	<h3>Things That Have Brought Me Strife</h3>
	<p>
		Many things in my life have made me unhappy, or just caused bunch of mixed emotions. In order to fully process myself and my unhappiness, I think the best thing to do might be to list them out, dedicate perhaps an entry to each, and gain some further insight into Why I Am The Way I Am. I’ve also decided to add a fun stock image to each journal entry - here is an image that comes up when you Google “strife stock image”:

		Without further ado, here are some things that have brought me stresses throughout my current and past life:
	</p>
	<ul id="bulleted-list" >
		<li>Weight/Body</li>
		<li>Fitness (see Weight/Body)</li>
		<li>Intelligence</li>
		<li>Inability to be Good Enough (see Intelligence)</li>
		<li>Family</li>
		<li>Finances</li>
		<li>Relationships/Love/Sex</li>
		<li>Friendships/Acceptance</li>
		<li>Food (see Weight/Body)</li>
		<li>Pseudo-perfectionism</li>
		<li>Acceptance vs. Improvement</li>
		<li>Happiness vs. Success</li>
		<li>Labels</li>
		<li>Feminism vs. Anti-feminism</li>
		<li>My Emotions™ and Why They Are The Way They Are</li>
		<li>mgh < &frac12;mv<sup>2</sup>  (or Why I Am Not Living Up To My Potential)</li>
		<li>Being easily persuaded/affected by other people</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Quite a list. The above was the order in which they came to me; below I will re-organize them in a way that makes sense to me. An abstract vs. concrete view, in order of importance (somewhat):
	</p>
	Concrete
	<ul id="bulleted-list">
		<li>Friendships</li>
		<li>Relationships/Love/Sex</li>
		<li>Weight/Body</li>

		<li>Food</li>
		<li>Intelligence</li>
		<li>Labels</li>
		<li>Family</li>
		<li>Finances</li>
	</ul>

	Abstract
	• Inability to be Good Enough (see Intelligence)
	• Pseudo-perfectionism
	• Acceptance vs. Improvement
	• Happiness vs. Success
	• mgh < 0.5mv^2  (or Why I Am Not Living Up To My Potential)
